// Parsing Rules
//
// 1. Identify relevant agents. Don't make up agents that are not in the list!
//
// 2. Generate an array of agent tasks in the format:
//
// {
//   "agent": "<agent name>",
//   "prompt": "<partial prompt from user request including all relevant details to this specific agent>"
// }
//
//
// 3. Generate a response summary that:
//
// For existing agents it acknowledges agent-specific actions in present perfect tense (e.g. "Showing transactions above 50$", "Navigating to transactions page").
//
// If the user request is not related to any agent, acknowledge that the request is not related to any agent and provide a professional response.
//
// Always return a json in this exact format:
// {
//     "response": <response summary>,
//     "agentTasks": [{"agent": ...,"prompt: ...}]
//
// All fields are mandatory.
